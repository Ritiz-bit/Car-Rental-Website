    <center><h4>Suv</h4></center>
    <p>SUVs are the perfect choice for customers who want space, comfort, and versatility in their travels. With roomy interiors, powerful engines, and advanced safety features, they are ideal for family vacations, group trips, or long-distance journeys. Their elevated seating position offers better visibility on the road, while ample luggage capacity ensures convenience for travelers carrying more. Whether navigating city streets or exploring off-road destinations, SUVs deliver a smooth and confident driving experience, making them one of the most popular options in any rental fleet.
👉 Would you like me to also create a marketing-style SUV description (short and catchy, like a brochure tagline) that you can use directly on your company’s website?

<div id="Sedan">
    <center><h4>Sedan</h4></center>
    <p>A sedan is one of the most popular car body styles, known for its practicality, comfort, and elegant design. It features a three-box layout with separate compartments for the engine, passenger cabin, and trunk, making it spacious and convenient for families and professionals alike. Sedans usually have four doors and a fixed roof, offering easy access and a smooth driving experience. They are favored for their balanced performance, fuel efficiency, and refined interiors, which make long journeys more enjoyable. In India, sedans range from affordable models like the Maruti Suzuki Dzire and Tata Tigor to premium options such as the Honda City, Hyundai Verna, and luxury cars from BMW or Mercedes-Benz. While SUVs dominate rough terrains with higher ground clearance, sedans remain the preferred choice for city driving and highway cruising. Their stylish appeal, comfort, and practicality ensure they continue to hold a strong place in the automobile market.</p>
